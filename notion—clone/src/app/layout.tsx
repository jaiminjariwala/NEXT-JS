  => This file is the main entry point of our application, and all the components are wrapped within it, as a CHILDREN. As a result, any code we write within this file, will be displayed on every route page we create. This unique file enables us to personalize the behavior of our application by providing a COMMON LAYOUT or TEMPLATE for all of the pages.

  => Any component we include in this file, will be shared throughout the entire application.

  => This Root Layout is SERVER-RENDERED, ensuring faster page loads and better SEO.

  => We cannot use client component viz. Header directly into the server component viz. layout.tsx (RootLayout), because it's not allowed

  => "children" represent any content or components that are rendered inside the ClientLayout component.
